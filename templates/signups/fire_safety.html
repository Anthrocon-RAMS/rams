<h2> Fire Safety Certification </h2>

The state of Maryland requires all Magfest staff to complete an online training course
from the Maryland fire marshal on crowd/fire safety.  There's no test; you just read
through some slides.  At the end, you are presented with a certificate, which contains
your certification number.

<br/> <br/>

Complete the course at
<a target="_blank" href="http://firemarshal.state.md.us/crowdmanager/">http://firemarshal.state.md.us/crowdmanager/</a>
and then enter your certification number below.  {% popup_link ../static/fire_cert_example.png "Click here" %}
to see an example certificate so you'll know where to look for the certification number.
