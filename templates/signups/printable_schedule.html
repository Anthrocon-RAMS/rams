After working each shift, make sure you get a department chair to initial under the <b>Worked</b> column below.
If your shifts are not marked as worked, you won't

    Free food is available for Staffers in the hospitality Suite, and your Staff badge also grants you entry to the Galaxy Cafe to purchase cheap food.  The Gaylord requests that we only use this cafeteria during these times:
    <ul>
        <li>Breakfast: 7 - 9am</li>
        <li>Lunch:  1 - 3pm</li>
        <li>Dinner: 7 - 9pm</li>
    </ul>
    To get to the Galaxy Cafe, go to the far back of the Maryland Ballroom foyer (go around the corner from where Registration is and walk all the way to the back).  Go through the doors and turn left.  Just before you get to the Security desk in the hallway, look to your left and there will be a wide set of stairs going down.  Go down those stairs and then the Galaxy Cafe will be on your right.
