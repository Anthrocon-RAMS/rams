        After working each shift, make sure you get the location chair to mark in our
        database that you worked your shift, or if you are working in an area without
        network access, get the department head to initial under the <b>Worked</b>
        column below.  If your shifts are not marked as worked,
        we'll think you didn't show up and you won't

        There is an attached sheet for tracking hours which aren't part of a regular shift.
        For example, if you work during a time when you are not
        scheduled, or show up especially early to a shift, or work long after your shift
        ended, then you can have the department head mark down these hours so that you
        will get credit for them.
