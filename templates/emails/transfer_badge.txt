{{ old.first_name }} and {{ new.first_name }},

Our records indicate that {{ old.full_name }} ({{ old.email }}) has transferred their MAGFest {{ old.get_badge_type_display }} registration to {{ new.full_name }} ({{ new.email }}).  So {{ old.full_name }} no longer has a paid registration, and {{ new.full_name }} should have no trouble picking up their badge at our registration desk.

If this has happened in error, please contact {{ REGDESK_EMAIL }}.
