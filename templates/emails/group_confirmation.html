Your {{ group.is_dealer|yesno:"group,Dealer registration" }} ({{ group.name }}) has been preregistered for
MAGFest and your payment of ${{ group.amount_paid }} has been received.  Every member of your group should
bring a photo ID to MAGFest, and you should have no trouble picking up your badges at our registration desk.

{% if group.unregistered_badges %}
    <br/> <br/>
    Some of your badges are not yet assigned to a specific person. If you assign these badges 
    now then it will take much less time for their owners to pick them  up at the convention. 
    You may <a href="{{ state.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/group_members?id={{ group.id|obfuscated }}">preassign your badges here</a>.
