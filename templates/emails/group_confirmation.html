Your {{ group.is_dealer|yesno:"Dealer registration,group" }} ({{ group.name }}) has been preregistered for
MAGFest and your payment of ${{ group.amount_paid }} has been received.  

Badges are not mailed out before the event, so badges for your group will be available for pickup at the 
registration desk when you arrive at MAGFest. Inform your group to bring a photo ID to the registration 
desk, where they'll be provided with their badge. If anyone in your group ordered bonus items such as a 
ribbon, t-shirt, or supporter package, they can can pick those up at our merchandise booth. The location 
and hours of the registration desk and merchandise booth will be e-mailed prior to the event.

    Some of your badges are not yet assigned to a specific person. If you assign these badges 
    now then it will take much less time for their owners to pick them  up at the convention. 
    You may <a href="{{ URL_BASE }}/preregistration/group_members?id={{ group.secret_id }}">preassign your badges here</a>.
