You ({{ attendee.full_name }}) have preregistered for MAGFest and your payment of ${{ attendee.amount_paid }}
has been received.

Badges are not mailed out before the event, so your badge will be available for pickup at the registration desk when you arrive at MAGFest. Simply bring a photo ID to the registration desk, where you'll be provided with your badge. If you ordered bonus items such as a ribbon, t-shirt, or supporter package, you can pick those up at our merchandise booth. The location and hours of the registration desk and merchandise booth will be e-mailed prior to the event.

{% if attendee.amount_extra %}
    <br/> <br/>
    Your additional contribution of ${{ attendee.amount_extra }} provides you with these bonus items, which may be picked up at our merch booth:
    <ul>
    {% for swag in attendee.donation_swag %}
        <li>{{ swag }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
{% endif %}
