Thanks so much for helping run MAGFest last year, we couldn't have pulled it off without so much help from our wonderful volunteers.  As thanks for your help, you're eligible for a complementary Staff badge for the next MAGFest, which will be {{ EPOCH|datetime:"%b %e" }} - {{ ESCHATON|datetime:"%e" }}.  You can accept your badge by visiting {{ URL_BASE }}/preregistration/confirm?id={{ attendee.secret_id }}

After you accept your Staff badge, you'll be emailed when next year's shifts become available.  Also, as a returning staffer, you'll also be eligible for complementary crash space in one of our staffer hotel rooms.  You'll be emailed closer to MAGFest with details about how to sign up for this.

If you want to return to MAGFest but don't want to volunteer again, just let us know and we'll swap your Staff badge for a complementary Attendee badge as thanks for the hard work you put in last time.

Please let us know if you have any questions.
