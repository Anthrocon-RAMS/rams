We're asking all department heads to double-check that people you want to get hotel room space are in Uber as being hotel eligible.  Anyone not signed up for hotel space by {{ state.ROOM_DEADLINE|datetime }} won't get space in our staff rooms!

You can see who in your department is currently eligible for hotel space at {{ state.URL_BASE }}/registration/hotel_eligible

If anyone should be receiving hotel space but isn't listed, please either give them a Staff badge in Uber or reply to this email to give STOPS a list of their names and email addresses.

If you're managing hotel room space for your people internally, please let us know ASAP how many rooms you need and who will be staying in them.
