There are a few methods for installing ubersystem.  

For first time users, we definitely recommend using Vagrant, which does a lot of the boring work for you and gets you up and running quickly.

Ubersystem is under active development, and if you run into any issues with setup, please get in touch with us at code at magfest dot org, or open an issue on the Github tracker.

Installation types
================
- [Vagrant Installation](INSTALL.vagrant.md)   (recommended method for developers) ***USE THIS***
- [Manual Installation](INSTALL.manually.md)
- coming soon: Installation/deployment with Puppet
- [Database utils / shortcuts](dbutils.md)
