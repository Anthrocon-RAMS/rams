to pick up your badge. If you ordered a t-shirt with your badge, you can pick it up with your badge.

    {{ EVENT_NAME }} has a no-refund policy for all registrations.  If for any reason you can't make it, we allow
    and encourage you to resell your registration for the exact price you paid for it.  To transfer your registration
    to another person, send them
    <a href="{{ URL_BASE }}/preregistration/transfer_badge?id={{ attendee.secret_id }}">this personalized link</a>,
    which will work until {{ UBER_TAKEDOWN|datetime }}.
