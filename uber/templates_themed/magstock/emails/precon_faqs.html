You are receiving this e-mail because you are pre-registered to attend {{ EVENT_NAME }} {{ YEAR }}.
Please refer to this FAQ for instructions on how to get your badge and where to find the schedule.

<br/> <br/>

<b>Where do I go when I arrive? How do I pick up my pass?</b>
<br/>
The first step is to go to the registration desk to pick up your pass. Registration will be near or in front of campsite registration. When you drive in, it's straight, then just beyond the pool.
<br/> <br/>

<b>Where can I pick up my t-shirt that I pre-ordered?</b>
<br/>
Registration handles all swag. If for some reason they can't handle your issue at the moment, try back a little later.

<br/> <br/>

<b>Where can I view a schedule of events?</b>
<br/>
The schedule of events will be on the A-Frame whiteboard located near registration. Paper schedules <i>may</i> be available. If there is an online schedule, we will e-mail you or let you know when you pick up your pass.
<br/> <br/>

<b>Will passes be sold at the door?</b>
<br/>
Yes. Full three-day passes will be available for $55.
