You ({{ attendee.full_name }}) deferred your attendee badge last year, so we have created a placeholder badge for you for 
{{ c.EVENT_NAME_AND_YEAR }} this coming {{ event_dates() }}. 
Please <a href="{{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/confirm?id={{ attendee.id }}">click here to claim your badge</a>, 
make sure your information is up-to-date, and review and agree to this year's <a href="{{ c.COVID_POLICIES_URL }}" target="_blank">COVID policy</a>.

{% if c.PREREG_HOTEL_ELIGIBILITY_CUTOFF %}
<br/><br/>Since you are already registered, you will automatically receive an individualized hotel booking link in advance of the 
hotel lottery. Please note if you do not claim your badge and update your personal information before the hotel 
cutoff date of {{ c.PREREG_HOTEL_ELIGIBILITY_CUTOFF|datetime_local }}, the booking link will be sent to the email address 
that you used to register last year. Please <a href="{{ c.HOTEL_POLICIES_URL }}">visit our hotel information page</a> 
for more information about booking hotel rooms.
{% endif %}

<br/><br/>Badges are not mailed out before the event, so your badge will be available for pickup at the registration desk when 
you arrive at {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}. Bring a photo ID and <a href="{{ c.COVID_POLICIES_URL }}" target="_blank">proof of vaccination</a>
to the registration desk, where you'll be provided with your badge.
{% if c.DONATIONS_ENABLED %} If you pre-order a t-shirt or other merch package, you can pick those up at our merchandise booth.
The location and hours of the registration desk and merchandise booth will be e-mailed prior to the event.{% endif %}
