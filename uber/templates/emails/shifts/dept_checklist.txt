{{ conf.full_description|safe }}{% if conf.slug == 'approve_setup_teardown' %}

Approvals here will affect setup/teardown permissions for your volunteers.{% endif %}{% if conf.slug == 'creating_shifts' %}

If you need us to import your shifts from last time, let us know at stops@magwest.org.{% endif %}

Please complete the following steps by {{ conf.deadline|datetime_local }}:

{% for membership in attendee.dept_memberships_as_checklist_admin -%}
* {{ c.URL_BASE }}{{ conf|dept_checklist_path(membership.department_id) }}

We need you to check and complete each step even if this doesn't apply to your department so that we know you've looked at it.

You can review the complete checklist of all information we'll eventually need from you at {{ c.URL_BASE }}/dept_checklist
