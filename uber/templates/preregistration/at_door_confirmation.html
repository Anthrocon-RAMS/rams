    <h2>Registration{{ completed_registrations|length|pluralize }} Saved!</h2>
    <p>
        Thank you for completing your at-door registration{{ completed_registrations|length|pluralize }}!
        Your badge{{ completed_registrations|length|pluralize }} for {{ completed_registrations|readable_join }} 
        ha{{ 's' if completed_registrations|length == 1 else 've' }} been registered under your account
        {{ account.email }}. You can <a href="../preregistration/homepage" target="_blank">log into your account</a> to view all 
        your badges at any time.
    </p>

    <p> 
        {% if account.at_door_attendees|length > completed_registrations|length %}
            It looks like your account already has at least one prior at-door registration.
        {% endif %}
        If you think you may have made a mistake, like registering the same badge twice, there's no need to worry -- you can
        request any adjustments you need at the registration desk before paying.
    </p>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
        Please join the line for at-door payments when you're ready to pay for and pick up your badge. Once you get near 
        the front of the line, keep an eye out for stations marked "Cash" or "Card" and make sure to go to a "Cash" station if you
        want to pay with cash.
        You can show the check-in barcode below to the volunteer at the registration desk to quickly look up your pending 
        registration{{ completed_registrations|length|pluralize }}. In addition to this barcode,
        <strong>please have your photo ID{{ completed_registrations|length|pluralize }} and payment ready when you get to the front
        of the line!</strong> This is a huge help for making badge pick-up faster for everyone. Thanks again!
