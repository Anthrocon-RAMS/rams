    <h2>{% if AFTER_DEALER_REG_DEADLINE %}You've been added to our waitlist!{% else %}Thanks for applying as a Dealer!{% endif %}</h2>

    We've received your application for {{ group.name }} to purchase a Dealer registration for {{ EVENT_NAME }}.

    <br/><br/>
    {% if AFTER_DEALER_REG_DEADLINE %}
        Since the Dealer's Room is currently full, you've been added to our waitlist, and we'll let you know by the end
        of May if a spot opens up for you.
    {% else %}
        We receive a flood of applications every year, which we respond to in the order in which we receive them.
        Approvals will be done as promptly as possible; usually within <strong>two weeks</strong> from application.
    {% endif %}

    <h3>What Happens Next</h3>
    After approval, you will be emailed a link to manage your Dealership. From this link, you will be able to:
    <ul>
        <li>Pay for your Dealership.</li>
        <li>Register your Dealer Assistants.</li>
        <li>Add more Dealer Assistants up to the limit for your table size.</li>
    </ul>

    Your Dealership payment includes the cost of tables and the base cost of your and your Dealer Assistants'
    memberships. After payment, you will be emailed a payment confirmation with a link to upgrade your personal
    membership. Your Dealer Assistants will also be able to buy upgrades for their own memberships and pay for those
    upgrades separately.

    <br/><br/>Later, you will receive an additional email about your placement within the Dealer's Room.

    <br/><br/>In the event we cannot accommodate your Dealership, you will receive an email. By default, you will still
    receive a Membership to Anthrocon, and it will be changed from Dealer to Attending (or Dealer+Sponsor to Sponsor, etc).
