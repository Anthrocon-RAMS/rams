<h4>ADA Room Information <button type="button" class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-primary" onClick="openCloseADA()"><i id="ada-icon" class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></button></h4>

    <p>
        We have a wide variety of ADA-compliant rooms which can accommodate those with mobility, hearing, or visual impairments.
        Note that {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} will likely receive more ADA requests than available rooms; once ADA rooms are exhausted, standard rooms are awarded.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the conclusion of the lottery, Accessibility Services reaches out to all room awards with an ADA request, regardless of the awarded room type.
        If an ADA request is made but the available rooms cannot accommodate your needs, your reservation may be canceled without penalty.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you do <strong>not</strong> require an ADA-compliant room, but would like to request an accomodation for medical need(s) (e.g., quiet floor placement, low floor placement, close proximity to elevators/stairs), please leave the checkbox below <strong>unchecked</strong>.
        Instead, after the lottery's conclusion, please reach out to Accessibility Services to discuss available options if you have been awarded a room. If the available rooms cannot accommodate your needs, the reservation may be canceled without penalty.
