<h3 align="center"> Supporter Badges </h3>

The Supporter Badge is a way for dedicated fans of MAGFest to give us a little extra cash 
to help make the convention better.  In exchange, we try to reward you with some swag
and special keepsakes.

<br/> <br/>

We don't announce everything that Supporters get in advance, but we always give away
most of the swag available at our store, such as a tshirt and sticker, and we
always make sure to give a few special items not available to non-Supporters.

<br/> <br/>

We also let you identify an <a href="affiliates.html">affiliate</a>; basically, this tells
us which groups are throwing the most financial support into MAGFest so that we can
reciprocate by doing cool things for those groups.
