<h3 align="center"> What You Get For Volunteering </h3>

The more hours you work, the more you get (don't forget about <a href="weightDesc.html">weighted hours</a>):
<ul>
    <li> Working at least 6 hours gets you a set of MAGFest swag: a sticker and tshirt. <br/><br/> </li>
    <li> Working at least 12 hours gets you food in addition to the swag.  We have professional chefs preparing 3 meals per day throughout the con, although our current venue severly limits our options, and for the most part we are unable to serve hot food.  <br/><br/> </li>
    <li> Working at least 18 hours gets you a refund on your badge (whatever the price of a regular attendee badge was when you registered) instead of the swag.  You still get the food, of course. <br/><br/> </li>
    <li> Working at least 24 hours gets you everything; the badge refund, tshirt, food, and swag. <br/><br/> </li>
</ul>
