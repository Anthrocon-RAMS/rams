# The Ubersystem Project

The Ubersystem Project is a web app written in Python and designed for high
customization to suit any event's needs. It's aimed largely at fandom events
and can track things like registration, events, staffers, groups, dealers,
jobs, game checkouts, etc.

This app was originally developed by [MAGFest](http://magfest.org) as their
internal registration system, named Ubersystem, and is now open source and
available for anyone to use. Eternal thanks to
[Eli Courtwright](https://github.com/EliAndrewC) for tirelessly developing
Ubersystem for over ten years.
